CLIEngine:
Check for overlapping definitions and conflicting var types.

Algebra:
Make multiplication print out more nicely for letters and constants. Potentially flag options.
Make expand() consistent for results considering expanding order.
Use bionomial coefficients or similar combinatorics to optimize power of sum distribution.
Simplification.
Implement the "doit" for existing functions, namely trigs.
Functions: factorial, ceil, floor, sgn, mod, exp (construction only).
Binary search for piecewise functions.
Piecewise functions.
Equality and inequality potentially.
